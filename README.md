# Continuous-Variable Cluster State Stabilizers

ðŸ“„ **Research Draft (with Prof. Olivier Pfister, University of Virginia)**  
This repository contains a draft research note exploring **measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC)** in **continuous-variable (CV) systems** through a stabilizer/nullifier framework.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
- Introduces a **generalized stabilizer formalism** for continuous-variable cluster states.  
- Describes how **nullifiers** extend the stabilizer framework to CV systems.  
- Explores protocols for teleporting **non-Clifford (non-Gaussian) resource states**, a key step toward **fault-tolerant universal quantum computation**.

- `CVQC.pdf` â€” Draft research note (main document).  
- Supporting diagrams and figures from the manuscript.

## ðŸš€ Motivation
Cluster-state quantum computing is a powerful paradigm, but extending stabilizer techniques to **continuous-variable systems** is non-trivial.  
This project contributes to bridging the gap between **qubit-based** and **continuous-variable architectures**, with potential implications for **error correction** and **universal quantum computing**.
